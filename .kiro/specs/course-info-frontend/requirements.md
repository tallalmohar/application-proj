## Introduction

This feature involves creating a professional frontend application to present CMPT 415 course information in an engaging and user-friendly way.

3. WHEN a user views assessment information THEN the system SHALL explain marking criteria based on code contributions and written reports
4. WHEN a user sees licensing information THEN the system SHALL clearly state that contributions must abide by project licenses like GPL

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a prospective student, I want to explore available projects in detail, so that I can understand what I would be working on and required skills.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the projects section THEN the system SHALL display both iCradle and CBR projects with equal prominence
2. WHEN a user selects a project THEN the system SHALL show project description, real-world impact, and technical details
3. WHEN a user views project requirements THEN the system SHALL list necessary skills, useful experience, and team size
4. WHEN a user reads project details THEN the system SHALL include development needs, technology stack, and customer information
5. WHEN a user views iCradle project THEN the system SHALL highlight healthcare impact in Uganda and Sierra Leone

2. WHEN a user navigates the interface THEN the system SHALL provide smooth transitions and clear visual feedback
3. WHEN a user views content on different devices THEN the system SHALL adapt layout appropriately for mobile, tablet, and desktop
4. WHEN a user interacts with project cards or sections THEN the system SHALL provide hover effects and clear call-to-action elements
5. WHEN a user scrolls through content THEN the system SHALL maintain good readability with appropriate typography and spacing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a course instructor, I want the information to be easily maintainable and updatable, so that I can keep course details current for each semester.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN course information needs updating THEN the system SHALL use a component-based structure that allows easy content modifications
2. WHEN new projects are added THEN the system SHALL support adding project information through reusable components
3. WHEN skills or requirements change THEN the system SHALL allow updates without requiring major code restructuring
